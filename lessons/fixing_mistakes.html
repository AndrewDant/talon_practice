				<h1>Dictation and fixing mistakes</h1>
				<p>Whether you are typing or using voice to make stuff appear on your screen, you are bound to make some errors along the way.
				You are going to pronounce a tongue twister, and this will probably make some mistakes. This practice session is going to be all about fixing those mistakes.
				If you wish to leave this lesson, you can press the 'Close' button, or simply say <span style="color: yellow">Control Whale</span> to press Ctrl+W to close this tab.

					Dictation is simple enough. Starting a sentence with the word <span style="color: yellow">say</span> or <span style="color: yellow">phrase</span> will turn on dictation mode and type out all the words you have said afterwards.
					If you just want to add a single word, you can start the word using the phrase <span style="color: yellow">word</span> as well.
					This doesn't always turn out perfectly as you want, so you need ways to fix these mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first way you can fix mistakes is the phrase <span style="color: yellow">undo that</span>, this will undo the last action you did. <span style="color: yellow">redo that</span> will undo the undoing.
					For smaller mistakes, you might want to use the phrase <span style="color: yellow">delete</span> which will press backspace to remove the last letter or your selection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now deleting single letters is fine and all, but you might get tired saying delete over and over again if you want to delete a long word or sentence. For this, you have a range of clear commands. <br/>
					<span style="color: yellow">clear line</span> for example will clear your entire current line. But you can also do a ton of things with your current cursor using direction words at the end.
					You can put a direction like left, up, right and down after a clear command. Saying <span style="color: yellow">clear word left</span> will clear the previous word, and <span style="color: yellow">clear word right</span> will clear the next one.
					But you can also say things like <span style="color: yellow">clear way up</span> to delete everything between your current cursor and the start of the file. <br/>
					Try playing around with commands <span style="color: yellow">clear (direction)</span> and <span style="color: yellow">clear way (direction)</span> to see what they do.<br/>
