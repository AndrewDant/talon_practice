				<h1>Special characters</h1>
				<p>These characters are used in all kinds of different ways depending on the programming language. You can't live without them.
				You can start the lesson by using <span style="color: yellow">go right</span> and then <span style="color: yellow">enter</span> or <span style="color: yellow">snap</span>. You can stop the time by saying <span style="color: yellow">Escape enter</span>.
				If you wish to leave this lesson, you can press the 'Close' button, or simply say <span style="color: yellow">Control Whale</span> to press Ctrl+W to close this tab.

					Punctuation is important both for programming and for writing. . is <span style="color: yellow">dot</span>, , is <span style="color: yellow">comma</span>, ? is <span style="color: yellow">question mark</span> and ! is <span style="color: yellow">bang</span>.
					As you can see, these are fairly logical, just like : being <span style="color: yellow">colon</span> and ; being <span style="color: yellow">semicolon</span>.<br/>
					Quoting things can be handy as well, and you can use ` <span style="color: yellow">back tick</span>, ' <span style="color: yellow">quote</span> and " <span style="color: yellow">dubquote</span> to place these characters. You might have to say <span style="color: yellow">space</span> after these sounds to make them show up<br/>
					
					Next up are the braces. There are multiple kinds of braces: {} which are <span style="color: yellow">left brace</span> and <span style="color: yellow">right brace</span>. () which are <span style="color: yellow">left paren</span> and <span style="color: yellow">right paren</span>, and [] which are <span style="color: yellow">left square</span> and <span style="color: yellow">right square</span>
					and <>, which technically aren't braces, but can be activated using <span style="color: yellow">left angle</span> and <span style="color: yellow">right angle</span> respectively. <br/>
					
					Now there are a number of miscelanious signs that I couldn't really fit in a category, so I'll just list them out here.
					
					= <span style="color: yellow">equals</span>, _ <span style="color: yellow">down score</span>, - <span style="color: yellow">minus</span>, + <span style="color: yellow">plus</span>, * <span style="color: yellow">star</span>, 
					# <span style="color: yellow">pound</span>, / <span style="color: yellow">slash</span>, \ <span style="color: yellow">back slash</span>, $ <span style="color: yellow">dollar</span>, % <span style="color: yellow">percent</span>, ^ <span style="color: yellow">caret</span>,
					& <span style="color: yellow">and sign</span>, | <span style="color: yellow">pipe</span>, @ <span style="color: yellow">at sign</span> and ~ for <span style="color: yellow">tilde</span>.

				<p>This is based on the knausj_talon repository. As with almost anything else in Talon, you can change the words for specific symbols around if they do not recognize well.<br/>
